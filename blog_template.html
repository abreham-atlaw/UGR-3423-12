    <h1 class="fs-300">The Future of AI</h1>
    <p>
    Artificial Intelligence is an extensive field of science that deals with Machine learning and the creation of smart machines that can act with little or no human interference. These machines have been supposedly tagged the future of technology since they will supposedly be able to think and act somewhat like humans.

A lot of big corporations are already diving into this field of technology, and one of the most common AI today is Apple’s Siri. Siri can do a whole lot of things, including calling your contacts, sending of SMS, show locations, play music, and a whole lot of other things.

The major question, however, is the possibility of having a true and independent AI. By true AI, I mean an AI that can completely think on its own without any form of human support. One of the foremost persons to raise this subject of this ability for an AI was the English mathematician, Alan Turing.

History recognizes Turing for breaking the Nazi encryption machine, Enigma, during World War II. About a decade later, he posed the simple question that got the world thinking, “Can machines think?”

In his 1950 paper, Turing charted a new course in the study of AI, which the world is still exploring today. While many believe that AI can be further developed to attain the full thinking dimension by man, others opine that it’s a futile dream.

     According to Yann LeCun (Professor of Computer Science at NYU and VP and Chief AI Scientist at Facebook), the technology of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is one of the most “promising directions” in machine learning. LeCun is an authority in the field and certainly knows the depth of research that has been put in to the industry by different people and corporations.

However, I am an outlier on this topic as I don’t believe that true AI exists. Judging from his previous lectures, Professor LeCun also doesn’t believe that true AI exists, which is why I am perplexed by his comments on GANs being promising.

This idea of two machines facing off to sharpen each other skills sounds interesting indeed, but I think it ignores some of the staples of ML and Data Science. First, the tools don’t have inherent value on their own, meaning outside of human direction/guidance.

You cannot teach a machine to play like a master chess player by feeding it basic chess rules and facing it off against another machine that is a beginner chess player. I can see slight time savings by giving a GAN remedial work, but all the valuable ML we have now is always sourced and verified by human intelligence.

Even with all of the choices and all the data, “machines” still cannot predict, discern, qualify, or create much past the level of a 5-year-old child. This should not be surprising, it’s very much analogous to the way the study of thermodynamics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics are related, but the rules of the first seldom hold in the latter.

Simulations of intelligence have a long way to go, and pitting them against one another in GAN as a way of discovering something new, is at best a McNamara fallacy (quantitative fallacy): “making a decision based solely on quantitative observations and ignoring all others.” Having all the data is not the only factor in making a ‘good’ decision.
Is it Possible to Break Standard AES Block Cipher Encryption Using Machine Learning?

My colleague once sought my opinion on the feasibility of training a machine learning system that could break standard AES block cipher encryption. The idea was to train an ML system with a set of AES ciphertexts labelled with the corresponding plaintexts (assume for simplicity that the encryption key is fixed). The hope was that it would generate an ML model that is able to invert AES, that is, decrypt ciphertexts into the corresponding plaintexts.

If this works, the model will successfully guess future unobserved plaintexts by processing ciphertexts through the learned function, thus breaking all modern secure communication and storage solutions. Brilliant idea, it seemed.

But, sadly, this idea won’t work because there is no pattern for the machine to learn as assumed by the statement: “let’s train an ML system with a set of AES ciphertexts labelled with the corresponding plaintexts.” The colleague is falsely assuming that ML can “find” key by looking at pairs of ciphertexts and plain texts.

However, there is no magic algorithm to undo a one-way trapdoor function. Of course, there is always brute force, trying all the combinations until you find the right one. But there is no way to “learn” from such a small dataset.

Machine learning is about analyzing large data sets, training, and finding the rules that exist to tie things together with math. In this case, however, the math used to relate the ciphertext and the plain text is designed to be irreversible, and the variables can only be discovered with brute force.
How To Retrain A Chatbot Machine Learning System To Interact Better With Users

Typical examples of chatbots are those used in banking sites for automated customer service. Usually, such bots are trained by looking at user chat records and discovering the highest mode among customer questions.

When we find the first-order mode for an array of questions, we can use the question as a first-order intent and use natural language processing to record all the possible ways a user can ask the same question.

We can look and see if there is a high correlation between the satisfaction of the user and the agent providing anyone answer or solution. If there is a high correlation between the users, this would be the algorithmic way of determining the most common question and the most satisfying answer.

Retraining such a chatbot would recommend a Supervised Learning Model (Discrete Variable Prediction) with a Decision Tree Classifier that is powered by a rich set of curated user intents.

Retraining the bot based on unedited chat transcripts is fine (and is probably best) as long as the models are preprocessed to dealing with missing data, handle data imputation, and handle categorical data.

The model should also be trained to encode class labels for classification problems, induce features to transform the data, and deal with dimensionality reduction, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
